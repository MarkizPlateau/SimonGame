## _General info_

This is a browser version of a memory game where the script creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If you make a mistake at any point, you have to start over. At each level, you will be prompted with the last - new element of the sequence, but you have to remember the whole sequence and perform it each time. I used jQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
